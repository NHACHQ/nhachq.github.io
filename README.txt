This is the experiment of hysteresis experiment

helper functions should be put in utils.js

now pilot-current have function for selecting images, but only one trial.

debugging details-----------------------------------------------------
2021.1.10 reason: pilot-sample does not run after adding animation
    1. wrong parameters were added to animation trials
    2. something about data collection. The data collection method of images and
    image sequences can be different.
    3. forgot to import utils.js
    4. forgot to add a comma
