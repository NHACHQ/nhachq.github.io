1. experiment design:
    # instead of divide into 4 blocks, let participants self-pregress
    # response ends trial, and with a notice after RESPONDED
2. code structure:
    # created new plugin jspsych-animation-response based on the original one,
        but added early stopping by response. Removed the data collection of
        stimuli, as it can be traced by trial tags.

**To-Do**
1. add progress bar
2. save data directly to github

**error report**
