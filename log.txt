**To-Do**

1. experiment design:
    # instead of divide into 4 blocks, let participants self-pregress
    # response ends trial, and with a notice after RESPONDED
2. code structure:
    # created new plugin jspsych-animation-response based on the original one,
        but added early stopping by response. Removed the data collection of
        stimuli, as it can be traced by trial tags.

**To-Do**
1. add progress bar
2. save data directly to github

**error report**

changes for the recent commits:
1. finished functions for variation trials
2. added an input variable to timeline variable generator: interval
3. changed the image selector from "" to '' for saving image paths, this is used later for displaying preexposure image
4. in images selector, from now, all trials will select images from the first 0 in the queue, and omit the last one.
5. bug fixed： all normal trials will be 30. (some used to be 31)

practice set9/10 info：[94.0, 175.0, 310.0]， can use any
set14/15 use the last transition: 
set 44/45 only the first transiton, recommended to be left screwed


about converting to webp format: I tried to convert to webp format, but the lossless compression made the file even bigger.
the lossy compression with 75% looks good, but it losses subtle details. I don't want to lose those details in a smooth
transition, and the current jpg format worked well so far as long as paths are preloaded. Therefore I chose to keep the current jpg format.

notes on coding:
there is a weird example:
        "correct" : false,
        "internal_node_id" : "0.0-3.0-1.0",
        "stimulus" : "stimuli/practice/0/000121.jpg",
        "time_elapsed" : 9099,
        "trial_index" : 4,
        "trial_tag" : "practice-random-0-29",
        "trial_type" : "categorize-image"
there is no "response" data, where if no key press there should be at least "response" :null
but there is nothing, which casued the code in data collection not working
so check if this field exists in the code
